1. Use the simple Flask application and build Dockerfile for it.

    python3 app.py

Create your own image (docker build) and try to run the container and interact with it by using your browser.
Don't forget to pass the valid ports by using -p. (e.g .: -p 8080: 8080)

    docker build -t first_image .
    docker images
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 first_image


Try to use such commands:
- docker run (with -d, -it, or without) {id}/{name},

    sudo service docker start
    docker run -d -it -p 8080:8080 first_image

- docker stop {id}/{name},

    docker stop 8c87b8570bce

- docker attach {id}/{name},

    docker attach 8c87b8570bce

- docker inspect {id}/{name},

    docker inspect f1d4ea14f70c

- docker logs {id}/{name}

    docker logs f1d4ea14f70c

Change the flask application to print your name and rebuild the image. Run the container again to verify the result.

    docker build -t new_image .
    docker images
    docker run -d new_image
2*.
    docker run -it --name my_story ubuntu
    docker run -p 8000:8080

• In the container, run echo "Your story" > story.txt

    echo "Your story" > story.txt

• Install cowsay with apt-get install cowsay and execute cat story.txt|cowsay.

    apt-get update && apt-get install cowsay
    cat story.txt|/usr/games/cowsay

• In another terminal window, run docker run -it --name my_story_2 ubuntu

    docker run -it --name my_story_2 ubuntu

• Using ls, check that there is no joke.txt file, because you are in another different container. Also,
there is no cowsay command.

    ls
    cat joke.txt|cowsay
